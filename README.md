#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the late  1960s the 'software crisis' exposed the inadequacies of coding practices. Projects were failing exceeding budgets and missing deadlines. This prompted the recognition that software development needed more rigorous, engineering-based approach which marked the birth of software engineering as a distinct discipline.
The paradigm shift with Structured and and onject oriented programming involved the developmet and adoption of structured programming in the 1970s followed by the object-oriented programming in the 1980s and 1990s. This changed how software was designed and built hence promoting modularity and top-down design and code reusability and complex system modeling.
The rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s ushered in a season of rapid software developmet. This era saw the emergence of agile methodologies which emphasized iterative development collaboration and adaptability. Swift responses became useful in handling the fast-paced nature of web development and need for quick responses to changing user requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the project must be completed before the next one begins whose emphasis is on thorough planning and documentation upfront whereas agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and adaptability and focuses on delivering working software in short cycles or sprints.
- Waterfall is best for projects with predictable requirements and a need for strict control while Agile is best for projects that require flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager is in charge of overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importace of IDEs
- IDEs streamline the development process by providing a comprehensive suite of tools within a single interface. This eliminates the need to switch between multiple applications, saving developers time and effort.   
- They enhance code quality through features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection.   
- IDEs simplify debugging with integrated debuggers that allow developers to step through code, inspect variables, and identify errors.   
- They facilitate project management by providing tools for organizing files, managing dependencies, and automating build processes.
An example of an IDE - IntelliJ IDEA

Importance of VCS
- VCS enables developers to track changes to their code over time, allowing them to revert to previous versions if needed.   
- It facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.   
- VCS provides a history of code changes, making it easier to identify the source of bugs and understand how the codebase has evolved.   
- It enables branching and merging, allowing developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation and then integrate them into the main codebase.
An example of VCS - Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
* Evolving Needs: Project requirements can shift throughout development, potentially expanding the scope and causing delays
* Time Constraints: Strict deadlines can pressure teams, potentially leading to hasty development and lower-quality software
* Accumulated Technical Issues: Shortcuts taken during development can create long-term problems, slowing future progress and increasing maintenance costs
Strategies
* Effective Problem-Solving: Addressing challenges requires clear communication, flexible development approaches like Agile, focused task prioritization, and consistent review of project objectives and schedules
* Proactive Project Management: To handle these challenges, teams should focus on clear communication, utilize adaptable methodologies like Agile, prioritize tasks strategically, and regularly evaluate project goals and timelines
* Strategic Adaptability: Teams can overcome these obstacles by fostering open communication, employing agile frameworks, prioritizing tasks, and routinely reassessing project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is essentially the art and science of crafting effective instructions, to elicit desired outputs from generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly large language models. Prompt engineering is vital because it maximizes the accuracy and relevance of AI outputs by crafting precise instructions, and it unlocks new applications by allowing users to control and personalize AI behavior.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
